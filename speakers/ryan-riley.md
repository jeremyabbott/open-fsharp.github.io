                    If you've long admired F#'s computation expressions (CEs) but never understood what was really required to build one yourself, this workshop is for you. We'll look at different styles of CEs and discuss building new ones from scratch, as well as extending existing CEs. We'll also look at what's required to build CE's that mix wrapper types, such as seq<option<&#39;a>>.

                    Web Assembly has been a more of a mythical creature for the last few years, but with the preview release of ASP.NET Blazor, F# developers can begin writing code to run directly in the browser! Weâ€™ll look at the various approaches you can use F# with Blazor, including the Elmish-styled Flatware library and a Fable-React-styled DSL.
