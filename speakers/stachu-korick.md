                    On trains, in classrooms, and in international competitions, the Rubik's Cube has consumed much of our population's time. In this session, we will study this puzzle through the lens of a curious F# developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, we will briefly introduce the history of the puzzle and how human and computer solving capabilities have entertwined, discovering more and more efficient means of solving. After discussing this at a high level, we will model the relevant domain, forming a common language and understanding.                                 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following our domain modeling, we will iterate through methods of solving, from naive brute-force approaches to heuristic-driven methods that take advantage of multiple processors. Throughout, appropriate and ergonomic user interfaces will be shown and made available for later study, powered by tools like Fable and Elmish.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a hands-on lab, and a laptop with F# and your IDE of choice will be instrumental in following along!
