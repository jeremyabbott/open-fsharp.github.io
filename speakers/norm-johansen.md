                    AWS Lambda is AWS's serverless compute platform. Lambda supports the .NET Core runtime with a very simple programming model that is .NET language agnostic. This lighting talk will show how to build and deploy F# serverless applications.

                        I'm the senior developer on the AWS .NET team. Which means I try and look to see where .NET is going and try to get AWS there. For the past couple years that has meant driving .NET Core across AWS. With F# now fully supported in .NET Core I have been looking to see how we can better support F# developers. I am also a frequent speaker for AWS and .NET.
