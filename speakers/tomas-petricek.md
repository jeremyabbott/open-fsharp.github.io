It needs an interactive user interface where users can edit data and formulas in cells, it needs to parse formulas that users write, it needs to evaluate formulas and show results on the fly and it also needs to handle errors such as division by zero and circular references. In this live coding session, Tomas will attempt to implement all of these features live on stage!-->

                        Tomas recently submitted his PhD thesis at the University of Cambridge focused on types for understanding context usage in programming languages, but his most recent work also includes two essays that attempt to understand programming through the perspective of philosophy of science.
