                    Q# is a new language under development at Microsoft Research, specially designed for quantum computing. F# has played a significant role in helping the development of this language, both in terms of tools used and in terms of influencing paradigms in the language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this talk, Iâ€™ll introduce some of the language features influenced by F#, and talk about the F# tools and concepts used, and finish with some personal notes of how my playing around with F# helped in my contributions to designing the language.
