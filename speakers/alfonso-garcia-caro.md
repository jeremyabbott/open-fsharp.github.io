                    After creating your shiny website, the next step is to build a mobile application for it. You know creating one for each platform takes a lot of work so you pick a crossplatform solutions: say, Xamarin or React Native. However, these still force you to master mobile development and go through rigid distribution channels (App or Play Store). What if you already have a responsive website and only want to use a few of the mobile features and just “look like” another native app? Can you imagine users installing your app just by visiting your web and using it offline right afterwards? Yes, it’s possible and it’s called Progressive Web Apps!

                    Fable 2 is coming and I want to talk to you about it: what benefits if brings to Fable projects, the performance improvements and how it can be used to better interact with JS tooling and libraries. I will also share with you the process of rewriting the code for this new major version, how it is to work with so many wonderful contributors and the lessons learned that hopefully can be applied to other projects as well. And we’ll end listing some productivity tricks to put your Fable projects in production in shorter time and with fewer bugs.
