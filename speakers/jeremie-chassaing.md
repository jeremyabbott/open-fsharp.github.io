                    Storing history rather than current state, Event Sourcing is a radical technic to implement efficiently Domain Driven Design. But many stop before even trying, convinced of the difficulty to implement it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The workshop will teach how to implement Event Sourcing. The functional approach leads to a simple, clear and production ready solution, and uncluttered domain code!

                    Monads are all the rage in FP land, but Applicatives, despite lack of love can help and save In Real Life situation. We'll learn to recognize them and use them, then with two example will see how far Applicatives can help.
