                    <p>
                        She originally started as a programmer but got interested in machine learning early on and did a mathematics PhD at the University of Cambridge. During her PhD, she worked on probabilistic models for getting insights from complex biomedical datasets. After that she worked in cancer research helping biologists analyse genomic data. Currently, she works as a Data Scientist in The Alan Turing Institute, the British national institute for data science.
