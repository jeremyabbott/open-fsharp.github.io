                    We are now about one year into implementing a largely F# environment for designing, building and analyzing engineered microorganisms. This is cloud deployed full stack F# (Fable, React, Elmish, Giraffe, Postgres) with algorithms for designing DNA, and web based systems for controlling robots and managing a lab. I will talk about what has worked well and where there are rough spots. I will touch on some areas of biology but it will be mostly about implementing a system for managing a complex manufacturing environment that is widely applicable to many industries.
